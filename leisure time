 What do you mean by leisure time? 

Leisure time, also known as free time or spare time, refers to the period when an individual is not occupied with work, studies, or other essential responsibilities. It is the time when a person is free to pursue activities of their choice, relax, and engage in hobbies or interests they enjoy. Leisure time is an essential aspect of life as it allows individuals to rest, recharge, and find enjoyment outside of their professional or academic commitments.

For a web developer like yourself, leisure time could involve various activities, such as:

1. Pursuing Personal Projects: Using your web development skills to work on personal projects or side projects that interest you, without any pressure or deadlines.

2. Learning New Technologies: Exploring and learning about the latest web development technologies, frameworks, and tools that you may not have had the opportunity to use in your regular work.

3. Participating in Coding Communities: Engaging with online coding communities, attending meetups, or contributing to open-source projects in your leisure time to connect with other developers and expand your knowledge.

4. Gaming: Playing video games or online games can be a popular way to relax and unwind for many web developers.

5. Reading or Watching Tech-related Content: Reading books or articles on web development, watching coding tutorials, or attending webinars to enhance your skills and knowledge.

6. Outdoor Activities: Participating in physical activities like sports, hiking, or biking to balance out the sedentary nature of web development work and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

7. Spending Time with Family and Friends: Allocating time to spend with loved ones and strengthen personal relationships.

8. Traveling: Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures can be a great way to recharge and gain new perspectives.

Remember, leisure time is crucial for maintaining a healthy work-life balance and preventing burnout. It allows you to recharge your creativity and productivity, making you more effective in your web development work when you return to it. It's essential to find a balance that allows you to enjoy your leisure activities while also dedicating time to your professional growth and responsibilities.
