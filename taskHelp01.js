Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step to understand how it calculates the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

1. Function `countVowelsAndConsonants` is defined:
```javascript
function countVowelsAndConsonants(str) {
  // Function takes a single parameter 'str', which is the input string we want to analyze.
  // The purpose of this function is to count the number of vowels and consonants in the input string.
```

2. The vowels and consonants are defined:
```javascript
const vowels = "aeiouAEIOU";
// This constant 'vowels' is a string containing all lowercase and uppercase vowels.
// Both lowercase and uppercase vowels are included to handle case-insensitivity.
```

3. Initialize counters for vowels and consonants:
```javascript
let vowelCount = 0;
let consonantCount = 0;
// Two variables 'vowelCount' and 'consonantCount' are declared and initialized to zero.
// These variables will be used to keep track of the count of vowels and consonants, respectively.
```

4. Loop through each character in the input string:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
  // A 'for' loop is used to iterate through each character of the input string.
  // The loop runs from index 0 to the last index (str.length - 1) of the string.
  // The variable 'i' is the loop index, representing the current position in the string.
  
  const char = str[i];
  // Inside the loop, we extract the character at the current index 'i' using 'str[i]'
  // and store it in a variable 'char'. This allows us to examine each character one by one.
```

5. Check if the character is a vowel:
```javascript
  if (vowels.includes(char)) {
    // We use the 'includes()' method of the 'vowels' string to check if 'char' is a vowel.
    // If 'char' is found in the 'vowels' string, it means it's a vowel.
    
    vowelCount++;
    // If the character is a vowel, we increment the 'vowelCount' variable by 1.
    // This helps us keep track of the total number of vowels encountered so far.
  }
```

6. Check if the character is a consonant:
```javascript
  else if (/[a-zA-Z]/.test(char)) {
    // If the character is not a vowel (checked in the previous 'if' condition),
    // we use a regular expression to check if it's an alphabetical character.
    // The regular expression /[a-zA-Z]/ matches any uppercase or lowercase letter.
    // It allows us to identify consonants among alphabetical characters.
    
    consonantCount++;
    // If the character is a consonant, we increment the 'consonantCount' variable by 1.
    // This helps us keep track of the total number of consonants encountered so far.
  }
```

7. Return the final counts as an object:
```javascript
return { vowels: vowelCount, consonants: consonantCount };
// After the loop finishes, we create an object containing the counts of vowels and consonants.
// The object has two properties: 'vowels' and 'consonants', which hold their respective counts.
// The function then returns this object as the final result.
```

8. Test the function with a sample input string:
```javascript
const inputString = "Hello, World!";
const result = countVowelsAndConsonants(inputString);
// We create a variable 'inputString' containing the string "Hello, World!" for testing purposes.

console.log("Number of vowels:", result.vowels);
console.log("Number of consonants:", result.consonants);
// The function is called with the test string 'inputString', and the result object is stored in 'result'.

// Finally, we print the counts of vowels and consonants to the console using 'console.log()'.
```

When you run this code, it will output:
```
Number of vowels: 3
Number of consonants: 7
```

This is because the string "Hello, World!" contains 3 vowels ('e', 'o', 'o') and 7 consonants ('H', 'l', 'l', 'W', 'r', 'l', 'd').
