Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step to understand how it checks if a given string is a palindrome.

1. Function `isPalindrome` is defined:
```javascript
function isPalindrome(str) {
  // The function takes a single parameter 'str', which is the input string we want to check for palindrome.
  // The purpose of this function is to determine whether the input string is a palindrome or not.
```

2. Clean the string:
```javascript
const cleanStr = str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '').toLowerCase();
// The input string 'str' is cleaned to remove non-alphanumeric characters and converted to lowercase.

// The 'replace()' method is used with a regular expression to remove non-alphanumeric characters.
// The regular expression /[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g matches any character that is not an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or digit.
// The 'g' flag ensures that all occurrences of non-alphanumeric characters are replaced.

// The 'toLowerCase()' method converts the cleaned string to lowercase to ensure a case-insensitive comparison.
// This is done to ignore differences in letter cases during palindrome checking.
```

3. Compare original and reversed strings:
```javascript
return cleanStr === cleanStr.split('').reverse().join('');
// The cleaned string 'cleanStr' is compared with its reverse to check if it's a palindrome.

// The 'split('')' method converts the cleaned string into an array of individual characters.
// This allows us to manipulate the string as an array and apply array methods.

// The 'reverse()' method is used on the array to reverse the order of its elements.

// The 'join('')' method is applied to the reversed array to join its elements back into a string.

// The comparison 'cleanStr === cleanStr.split('').reverse().join('')' checks if the original cleaned string
// is equal to its reversed version. If they are the same, it means the input string is a palindrome.
// If the comparison is true, the function returns 'true', indicating that the string is a palindrome.
// Otherwise, it returns 'false', indicating that the string is not a palindrome.
```

4. Test the function with a sample input string:
```javascript
const inputString = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!";
const result = isPalindrome(inputString);
// We create a variable 'inputString' containing the string "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" for testing.

console.log(result ? "It's a palindrome." : "It's not a palindrome.");
// The function is called with the test string 'inputString', and the result is stored in 'result'.

// Finally, we print the result to the console using 'console.log()'.
```

In the example provided, the input string is "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!". After cleaning it by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase, the cleaned string becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama". Since this cleaned string remains the same when reversed, it's a palindrome. Therefore, the code will output: "It's a palindrome."

Palindrome strings are the ones that read the same forwards and backward, and the code successfully identifies them using the cleaning and comparison steps.
